# Stock-Search-App

This is a simple stock search application I created which allows you to create buttons for stocks available from the iexTrading API. I have created five built-in buttons as favorties which are the most popular stocks. They are: 

* Google
* Apple
* Amazon
* Tesla
* Facebook

You can add additional stocks to your favorites by inputting the stock name and clicking on the add button. For the individual stocks, the available informaton are:

* Company Name
* Stock Price
* CEO
* Description
* Industry
* Tags
* Website and
* Top News
